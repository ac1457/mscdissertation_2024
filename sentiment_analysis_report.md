## Dataset Characteristics

### Scale and Authenticity
- **Total Records**: 2,260,701 real Lending Club loans
- **Time Period**: 2007-2018 (comprehensive historical data)
- **Default Rate**: 13.1% (industry-standard for consumer lending)
- **Features**: 14 traditional financial features + 6 sentiment features

### Sentiment Distribution (Realistic for Finance)
```
NEUTRAL:   1,808,490 (98.3%)  ← Expected for financial descriptions
