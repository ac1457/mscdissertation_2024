5000.0,car,"I am a high school teacher seeking a loan to purchase a reliable, but modestly priced car. In the past year and a half, my husband and I have paid off over $15,000 of credit card and auto debt that we slowly accrued while I was a stay-at-home mom. We were looking forward to paying the rest off by springtime, but both of our well-worn cars (over 230K miles each!) have bitten the dust within two weeks of each other. Except for a small emergency fund, all of our extra income has gone toward debt repayment, so we don’t have enough cash on hand to replace both cars at once. Standard auto loans require that the cars be 2003 or newer, and that we spend at least $7,500 on each—but that’s way more than we need or want to borrow! My credit score is excellent, so the interest rate they’ve offered is good, but I’m hoping to demonstrate for my kids some good old fashioned fiscal responsibility—by minimizing debt and working toward a more secure financial future. We’ve researched our local market, and have found that a $5000 loan-- combined with the cash we have-- will purchase two older but highly reliable cars that, if not too pretty, will get us through our daily work and school commutes safely and reliably. Thank you for your generous consideration! D. Loving",NEUTRAL,0.997
