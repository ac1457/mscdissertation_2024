## 3. Data and Methodology

### 3.1 Data Source and Collection

#### 3.1.1 Primary Dataset: Lending Club
The primary dataset for this research is the Lending Club loan data, obtained from Kaggle (wordsforthewise/lending-club). Lending Club is one of the largest peer-to-peer lending platforms in the United States, providing a comprehensive dataset of loan applications and outcomes from 2007 to 2018.

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- **Source**: Lending Club platform (2007-2018)
- **Original Size**: 2,260,701 loan records
- **Processed Sample**: 97,020 records (for computational efficiency)
- **Time Period**: 11 years of lending data
- **Geographic Coverage**: United States

#### 3.1.2 Data Availability and Sampling
Due to computational constraints and the need for balanced analysis, a stratified sample of 100,000 records was selected from the original 2.26 million records. The sampling strategy ensured:
- Representative distribution across loan grades (A through G)
- Balanced representation of loan purposes
- Temporal coverage across the entire dataset period
- Preservation of key demographic and financial characteristics

### 3.2 Data Structure and Variables

#### 3.2.1 Traditional Credit Features
The dataset contains 151 original features covering traditional credit risk indicators:

**Demographic Information:**
- Employment length and title
- Annual income
- Home ownership status
- Geographic location (state, zip code)

**Financial Characteristics:**
- Loan amount and funded amount
- Interest rate and installment amount
- Debt-to-income ratio (DTI)
- Credit grade and sub-grade

**Credit History:**
- FICO score ranges (low and high)
- Number of open accounts
- Public records and bankruptcies
- Credit inquiries in last 6/12 months
- Delinquency history

**Loan Performance:**
- Loan status (current, charged off, defaulted, etc.)
- Payment history
- Total payments received
- Recovery amounts

#### 3.2.2 Text Data and Synthetic Generation

**Original Text Data:**
- **Loan Descriptions**: Borrower-provided text explaining loan purpose
- **Coverage**: 93,476 records (96.3%) had missing descriptions
- **Quality**: Variable text length and quality

**Synthetic Text Generation:**
To address the significant missing text data, a synthetic text generation approach was implemented:

**Methodology:**
1. **Purpose-Based Templates**: Created realistic loan descriptions based on loan purpose
2. **Variation Introduction**: Added natural language variation to avoid artificial patterns
3. **Contextual Relevance**: Ensured generated text aligns with loan characteristics
4. **Quality Validation**: Implemented distribution similarity tests

**Generation Process:**
```python
# Example generation for debt consolidation
templates = [
    "Looking to consolidate multiple credit card debts into one manageable payment.",
    "Need to consolidate high-interest debts for better financial management.",
    "Want to combine several loans into one with lower interest rate."
]
```

**Validation Results:**
- **Distribution Similarity**: Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests confirmed synthetic text maintains similar statistical properties to real text
- **Feature Stability**: No significant drift detected in text-based features
- **Predictive Power**: Synthetic text features show meaningful predictive value

### 3.3 Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

#### 3.3.1 Missing Value Handling
**Missing Data Analysis:**

- **Credit History**: Variable missing rates (0.1% - 15.2%) - handled through appropriate imputation

**Imputation Strategy:**
- **Categorical Variables**: Mode imputation
