   - What is the relative importance of different text features in credit risk prediction?
   - How do different model integration approaches affect performance?
   - What is the business value of sentiment-enhanced credit risk modeling?

#### 4.1.2 Research Hypotheses
**H1**: Sentiment-enhanced credit risk models will demonstrate superior predictive performance compared to traditional models.

**H2**: Text complexity features will provide incremental predictive value beyond basic sentiment scores.

**H3**: Model integration approaches (early fusion, attention mechanisms) will outperform simple feature concatenation.

**H4**: Sentiment-enhanced models will provide measurable business value through improved default prediction.

### 4.2 Analytical Framework

#### 4.2.1 Model Development Approach
**Multi-Stage Development Process**:

1. **Baseline Models**: Traditional credit risk models using only financial features

3. **Advanced Integration**: Early fusion, attention mechanisms, model stacking
4. **Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning and feature selection

#### 4.2.2 Feature Set Construction
