# Lending Club Sentiment Analysis Project Summary

## Project Overview

This dissertation project investigates the enhancement of traditional credit risk models through sentiment analysis of loan descriptions. The project uses real Lending Club data with synthetic text generation to address missing descriptions.

## Key Achievements

### Real Data Integration
- Successfully downloaded and processed 2.26M real Lending Club loan records
- Sampled 100K records for computational efficiency
- Generated synthetic descriptions for 93,476 missing text fields
- Created 165 total features (151 original + 14 enhanced)

### Analysis Pipeline
- Comprehensive feature engineering with sentiment, text complexity, and financial indicators
- Multiple model integration approaches (early fusion, attention mechanisms, model stacking)
- Robust statistical evaluation with bootstrap CIs, permutation tests, and temporal validation
- Advanced ablation studies and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis

### Results Summary
- **Baseline Performance**: AUC ~0.56 (real data vs ~0.52 synthetic)
- **Best Enhancement**: Sentiment_Interactions (+0.0054 AUC improvement)
- **Feature Importance**: word_count, text_length, sentence_length_std
- **Practical Significance**: Modest but measurable improvements across all regimes

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing
- **Source**: Kaggle Lending Club dataset (wordsforthewise/lending-club)
- **Processing**: Automated download, cleaning, and feature engineering
- **Quality**: Comprehensive validation and missing value handling
- **Output**: 97,020 clean records with 165 features

### Feature Engineering
- **Sentiment Analysis**: 4 categories (positive, negative, neutral, financial stress)
- **Text Complexity**: 8 metrics (TTR, sentence length, word count, etc.)
- **Entity Extraction**: 4 entity types (job stability, financial hardship, etc.)
- **Financial Indicators**: Keyword density, financial terms, interaction features

### Model Development
- **Traditional**: Baseline credit risk features
- **Sentiment**: Text-based sentiment features
- **Hybrid**: Combined traditional and sentiment features
- **Advanced**: Multiple fusion approaches and ensemble methods
