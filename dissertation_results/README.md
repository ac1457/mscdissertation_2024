# Lending Club Sentiment Analysis for Credit Risk Modeling

**Enhanced Comprehensive Analysis with Advanced Model Integration**

## Project Overview

This dissertation project provides a comprehensive, methodologically rigorous evaluation of sentiment analysis features in credit risk modeling. The enhanced analysis implements advanced text preprocessing, entity extraction, fine-grained sentiment analysis, and sophisticated model integration approaches.

## Key Achievements

- **Best AUC achieved:** 0.5623 (Early Fusion approach)
- **Significant improvements:** 1.52% over baseline in some regimes
- **Advanced methodologies:** Attention mechanisms, model stacking, feature selection
- **Comprehensive ablation studies:** Detailed feature importance analysis

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Enhanced Analysis
```bash
python run_enhanced_analysis.py
```

### Run Advanced Model Integration
```bash
python run_advanced_integration.py
