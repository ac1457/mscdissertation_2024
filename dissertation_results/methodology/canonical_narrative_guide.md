## **NARRATIVE STRUCTURE TEMPLATE**

### **Executive Summary**
```
This analysis investigates the incremental value of sentiment features in traditional 
credit risk modeling using synthetic loan descriptions. Results demonstrate modest but 
consistent improvements across multiple algorithms and feature combinations. The work 
provides a framework for systematic sentiment integration while acknowledging the 
limitations of synthetic data and the need for further validation.
```

### **Key Findings**
```
• Sentiment features provide modest but consistent improvements to traditional models
• Hybrid feature combinations show the strongest performance
• Improvements are statistically significant but practically modest
• Results approach industry standards for lower default rates
• Further validation needed for production deployment
```

### **Conclusions**
```
The analysis demonstrates that sentiment analysis provides incremental value to 
traditional credit risk modeling. While improvements are modest, they are consistent 
across multiple algorithms and feature combinations. The work establishes a framework 
for systematic sentiment integration and highlights the importance of realistic 
validation approaches. Future work should focus on real-world data validation, 
cost-benefit analysis, and temporal stability assessment.
```

### **Limitations**
```
• Synthetic data may not reflect real-world performance
• Limited text length and lexical diversity
• No temporal validation in this analysis
• Cost-benefit analysis not included
• Fairness assessment not performed
• Production deployment requires additional validation
```

## **METRIC REPORTING STANDARDS**

### **AUC Improvements**
- **Format**: "AUC improvement of +0.0234 (+3.45%)"
- **Context**: "modest but statistically significant"
- **Comparison**: "approaches but does not exceed industry benchmarks"

### **Statistical Significance**
- **Language**: "statistically significant but practically modest"
- **Context**: "large sample size may inflate statistical significance"
- **Interpretation**: "focus on effect size, not just p-values"

### **Effect Size**
- **Small**: 0.01-0.03 AUC improvement
- **Medium**: 0.03-0.05 AUC improvement  
- **Large**: >0.05 AUC improvement
- **Current Results**: "consistently in the small to medium range"
