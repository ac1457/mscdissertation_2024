SAMPLING METHODOLOGY DOCUMENTATION
==================================

1. ORIGINAL DATASET CHARACTERISTICS
-----------------------------------
- Source: Synthetic loan descriptions with balanced target
- Original size: 50,000 records
- Original default rate: 51.3% (artificially balanced for experimental purposes)
- Purpose: Internal benchmarking and controlled comparison

2. REALISTIC PREVALENCE SUBSET CREATION
---------------------------------------
Method: Stratified downsampling of majority class

Process:
1. Start with balanced dataset (51.3% default rate)
2. For each target prevalence (5%, 10%, 15%):
   a. Calculate required sample sizes for target prevalence
   b. Apply stratified sampling to maintain class distribution
   c. Split into train/test (80/20) with stratification
   d. Verify actual prevalence matches target

3. SAMPLING DETAILS BY REGIME
-----------------------------
- 5% Default Rate: Stratified downsampling to achieve ~5% prevalence
- 10% Default Rate: Stratified downsampling to achieve ~10% prevalence  
- 15% Default Rate: Stratified downsampling to achieve ~15% prevalence

4. TRAIN/TEST SPLIT METHODOLOGY
-------------------------------
- Split ratio: 80% train, 20% test
- Stratification: Yes (maintains prevalence in both splits)
- Random seed: Fixed for reproducibility
- Cross-validation: Not applied (focus on robust testing)

5. INDEPENDENCE OF SUBSETS
--------------------------
- Each prevalence regime is created independently
- Different random seeds for each regime
- No overlap between regimes
- Each regime has its own train/test split

6. REPRODUCIBILITY
------------------
- Fixed random seeds for all sampling operations
- Complete documentation of sampling parameters
- Sample counts provided for verification
- Methodology fully reproducible

7. LIMITATIONS AND CAVEATS
--------------------------
- Synthetic target variable for demonstration
- In real implementation, would use actual loan outcomes
- Prevalence targets are approximate (may vary slightly due to sampling)
- Balanced original dataset is not representative of real-world prevalence

8. VALIDATION
-------------
- Sample counts verified for each regime
- Prevalence rates confirmed within acceptable tolerance
- Train/test splits maintain stratification
- Independence between regimes confirmed
