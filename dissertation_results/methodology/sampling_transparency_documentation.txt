REPRODUCIBILITY INFORMATION
------------------------------
Random seed: 42
Cross-validation: 5-fold stratified
Train/test split: 80/20 stratified
Shuffle: True (for both CV and train/test)

LIMITATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS
--------------------------------
• Synthetic target generation: Default rates are artificially created
• No temporal component: All data treated as contemporaneous
• Stratified sampling: Maintains class balance in splits
• Fixed random seed: Ensures reproducibility
• No data leakage: Features and targets are independent

RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------
• Use realistic prevalence regimes for external interpretation
• Balanced regime for internal benchmarking only
• Validate sampling stability with different random seeds
• Consider temporal validation for real-world deployment
• Document any changes to sampling methodology
