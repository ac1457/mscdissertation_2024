SYNTHETIC TEXT GENERATION METHODOLOGY REPORT
============================================

Generated: 2025-08-14 11:11:06

1. RESEARCH CONTEXT
------------------
Purpose: Address data scarcity in credit modeling research
Motivation: Real loan descriptions are limited and often unavailable for research
Approach: Generate synthetic loan descriptions with controlled sentiment

2. METHODOLOGY ADVANTAGES
-------------------------
- Controlled sentiment distribution
- Scalable dataset generation
- Privacy-preserving approach
- Reproducible research methodology

3. METHODOLOGY LIMITATIONS
--------------------------
- May not capture real-world text complexity
- Limited domain-specific vocabulary
- Potential bias in generation patterns
- Requires validation against real data

4. GENERATION PROCESS
---------------------
Step 1: Define loan purpose categories
  Categories: Debt consolidation, Home improvement, Major purchase, Medical expenses, Education, Business, Auto loan, Other

Step 2: Create sentiment templates
  Sentiment Levels:
    NEGATIVE: Financial stress, urgency, limited options
    NEUTRAL: Standard loan request, normal circumstances
    POSITIVE: Investment opportunity, stable situation, growth

Step 3: Generate synthetic descriptions
  Technique: Template-based generation with controlled sentiment
  Parameters:
    text_length: Variable length (50-200 words)
    sentiment_distribution: Balanced across sentiment levels
    purpose_distribution: Based on Lending Club historical data
    vocabulary: Domain-specific financial and personal terms

Step 4: Sentiment analysis application
  Model: Pre-trained sentiment analysis model
  Features Extracted:
    - sentiment_score (continuous)
    - sentiment_confidence (0-1)
    - sentiment_category (NEGATIVE/NEUTRAL/POSITIVE)
    - text_length (character count)
    - word_count (word count)

5. QUALITY CONTROL
------------------
Validation Steps:
- Sentiment distribution verification
- Text length distribution analysis
- Vocabulary diversity assessment
- Purpose category balance check
- Sentiment analysis consistency validation

Quality Metrics:
- sentiment_consistency: Agreement between generated sentiment and analysis
- text_diversity: Vocabulary richness and variety
- purpose_balance: Even distribution across loan purposes
- length_distribution: Realistic text length patterns

6. DATA CHARACTERISTICS
-----------------------

Text Length Statistics:
  Mean: 48.6 characters
  Standard Deviation: 27.2 characters
  Range: 30 - 140 characters
  Median: 36.0 characters

Sentiment Distribution:
  NEGATIVE: 14,774 samples (29.5%)
  NEUTRAL: 25,288 samples (50.6%)
  POSITIVE: 9,938 samples (19.9%)

7. METHODOLOGICAL TRANSPARENCY
------------------------------
This report documents the complete synthetic text generation process to ensure
methodological transparency and reproducibility. The synthetic approach addresses
the critical data scarcity problem in credit modeling research while maintaining
controlled experimental conditions.

8. VALIDATION APPROACH
----------------------
The synthetic text generation process is validated through:
- Sentiment distribution verification
- Text quality assessment
- Vocabulary diversity analysis
- Consistency checks with sentiment analysis models

9. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION
------------------------
This methodology contributes to the field by:
- Providing a framework for sentiment analysis in credit modeling
- Addressing data scarcity challenges in financial research
- Enabling controlled experiments with sentiment features
- Supporting reproducible research in credit risk assessment

10. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------------
Potential enhancements include:
- Domain-specific language models for financial text
- Real-world validation against actual loan descriptions
- Advanced sentiment analysis models (BERT, FinBERT)
- Multi-language support for international credit markets
