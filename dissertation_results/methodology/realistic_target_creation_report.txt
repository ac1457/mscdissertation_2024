REALISTIC TARGET CREATION REPORT
========================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------
This report documents the creation of realistic synthetic targets
based on actual loan features rather than random noise.
Targets are designed to reflect realistic relationships between
loan characteristics and default probability.

METHODOLOGY
---------------
• Base default rate established for each regime
• Risk factors calculated from actual features:
  - Sentiment score (negative sentiment increases risk)
  - Text complexity (longer descriptions indicate issues)
  - Financial terms (presence indicates higher risk)
  - Purpose (different purposes have different risk levels)
  - Sentiment confidence (low confidence indicates uncertainty)
• Realistic noise added to probabilities
• Reasonable bounds enforced (1% to 30% default rate)

REGIME SUMMARY
---------------

5% Regime:
  Base rate: 5.0%
  Actual rate: 16.0%
  Total loans: 10,000
  Defaults: 1,599
  Non-defaults: 8,401

10% Regime:
  Base rate: 10.0%
  Actual rate: 20.3%
  Total loans: 10,000
  Defaults: 2,031
  Non-defaults: 7,969

15% Regime:
  Base rate: 15.0%
  Actual rate: 24.9%
  Total loans: 10,000
  Defaults: 2,486
  Non-defaults: 7,514

FEATURE-TARGET RELATIONSHIPS
------------------------------
  sentiment_score: +0.0149
  sentiment_confidence: -0.0114
  text_length: +0.0982
  word_count: +0.0982
  sentence_count: +0.0933

LIMITATIONS
------------
• Synthetic targets based on assumptions about risk factors
• Real-world default rates may differ significantly
• Feature relationships are simplified approximations
• No temporal component (all loans treated as contemporaneous)
• No external economic factors considered

RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------
• Use real loan performance data when available
• Validate assumptions with domain experts
• Consider temporal and economic factors
• Test with external datasets
• Acknowledge synthetic nature in conclusions
