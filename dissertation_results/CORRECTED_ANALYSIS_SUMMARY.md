**Date:** December 2024  
**Author:** AI Assistant  
**Analysis Version:** Corrected Rigorous v1.0

## Executive Summary

This corrected analysis addresses all identified inconsistencies in the previous work, providing honest and accurate reporting of results with proper statistical rigor.

### Key Findings:
- **No statistically significant improvements** after multiple comparison correction
- **Modest effect sizes** that barely meet practical thresholds
- **Inconsistent performance** across regimes and models
- **Negative incremental defaults** in top 10% selection
- **Weak overall discrimination** (AUC ~0.51-0.52)

---

## Inconsistencies Fixed

### 1. ΔAUC Calculation Mismatches - RESOLVED
- **Previous error:** Reported permutation table ΔAUC (0.011, 0.012) differed from computed values
- **Fix:** Consistent calculation using mean AUC differences across folds
- **Corrected values:** 0.0052, 0.0139, 0.0227 (vs. previous 0.011, 0.012, 0.016)

### 2. Significance Claims - RESOLVED
- **Previous error:** "Permutation tests confirm signal in 2/3 regimes" overstated evidence
- **Fix:** Primary (label) permutation tests show no significant improvements
- **Corrected:** 0/3 regimes significant after multiple comparison correction

### 3. Practical Threshold Enforcement - RESOLVED
- **Previous error:** 10% regime improvement (0.0098) below threshold yet treated as improvement
- **Fix:** Consistent application of ΔAUC ≥ 0.01 threshold
- **Corrected:** Only 2/3 regimes meet practical threshold

### 4. Multiple Testing Adjustment - RESOLVED
- **Previous error:** Holm correction mentioned but adjusted p-values not shown
- **Fix:** Explicit adjusted p-values in consolidated table
- **Corrected:** All p-values adjusted for 6 comparisons (2 per regime)

### 5. Effect Size Interpretation - RESOLVED
- **Previous error:** Wide CI overlap not emphasized
- **Fix:** Clear reporting of standard errors and practical indistinguishability
- **Corrected:** All best models' CIs largely overlap with baseline

## Corrected Results

### Consolidated Results Table:

| Regime | Best Model | AUC (mean±SE) | ΔAUC | Raw p (Primary) | Adjusted p | Meets Practical Threshold | Incremental Defaults (Top 10%) |
|--------|------------|---------------|------|-----------------|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 5% | Hybrid | 0.5229 ± 0.0331 | 0.0052 | 0.414 | 0.414 | **N** | -29 |
| 10% | Hybrid | 0.5239 ± 0.0114 | 0.0139 | 0.080 | 0.240 | **Y** | -14 |
| 15% | Hybrid | 0.5157 ± 0.0200 | 0.0227 | 0.054 | 0.216 | **Y** | -16 |

### Key Corrections:

1. **ΔAUC Values:** Now correctly calculated and consistent
2. **Statistical Significance:** No significant improvements after correction
3. **Practical Threshold:** Only 2/3 regimes meet ΔAUC ≥ 0.01
4. **Incremental Defaults:** **Negative values** indicate worse performance
5. **Standard Errors:** Wide uncertainty (SE ~0.01-0.03) shows practical indistinguishability

## Critical Findings

### 1. No Statistically Significant Improvements
- **Primary test (label permutation):** All p-values > 0.05
- **Multiple comparison correction:** No rejected hypotheses
- **Secondary test (feature permutation):** Only marginally significant in some cases

### 2. Negative Business Impact
- **Incremental defaults:** All negative (-29, -14, -16)
- **Top 10% selection:** Hybrid model captures fewer defaults than baseline
- **Cost implications:** Worse performance despite higher AUC

### 3. Weak Discrimination Overall
- **AUC range:** 0.49-0.52 (near random performance)
- **Standard errors:** Large uncertainty (0.01-0.03)
- **CI overlap:** All confidence intervals overlap substantially

### 4. Inconsistent Performance
- **Best model varies:** Hybrid wins but with negative business impact
- **Regime differences:** Performance not robust across default rates
- **Sampling noise:** Likely explanation for near-random results
