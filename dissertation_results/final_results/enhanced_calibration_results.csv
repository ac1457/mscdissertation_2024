# 
# CONFIGURATION:
# - Random State: 42
# - Bootstrap Method: BCa (1000 resamples)
# - CV Folds: 5
# - Calibration Bins: 10
# - Cost Matrix: Default=1000, Review=50
# - Rejection Rates: [5, 10, 20]%
#
# ENHANCED METRICS:
# - BCa Bootstrap CIs: Bias-corrected accelerated confidence intervals
# - DeLong Structural: Proper DeLong test using structural components
# - Calibration Before/After: Pre- and post-Platt scaling metrics
# - Threshold-Dependent: Metrics at fixed rejection rates
# - Cost-Benefit Analysis: Explicit cost matrix and savings
#
# METRICS GLOSSARY:
# AUC: Area Under ROC Curve (0.5 = random, 1.0 = perfect)
# PR-AUC: Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (better for imbalanced data)
# AUC_SE: Standard error of AUC from bootstrap
# AUC_Diff_vs_Traditional: AUC_variant - AUC_traditional (positive = improvement)
# DeLong_Z: Z-statistic from DeLong test (structural components)
# DeLong_p: P-value from DeLong test (structural components)
# Brier_Before/After: Brier score before/after Platt scaling
# Brier_Improvement: Brier_Before - Brier_After (positive = improvement)
# ECE: Expected Calibration Error (lower = better calibration)
# Calibration_Slope: Slope of calibration curve (1.0 = perfectly calibrated)
# Lift@k%: Ratio of default rate in top k% vs overall default rate
# Cost_Savings: Expected cost savings from model deployment
# Cost_Matrix: Explicit cost structure (TP, FP, FN, TN costs)
