# 
# TODO: Implement true DeLong test (current DeLong_approximation placeholder)
# TODO: Add permutation null & ablation (scheduled Day 4)
# TODO: Add richer text baselines (scheduled Day 5)
# TODO: Add temporal validation (scheduled Day 6)
# TODO: Add interpretability analysis (scheduled Day 7)
# TODO: Add governance/fairness assessment (scheduled Day 10)
#
# FIXES APPLIED:
# - Corrected Î”AUC computation (Variant_AUC - Traditional_AUC)
# - Fixed regime labeling (16%, 20%, 25% instead of 5%, 10%, 15%)
# - Implemented proper DeLong test approximation
# - Added missing PR-AUC and confidence intervals
# - Applied Platt scaling for calibration improvement
# - Fixed lift calculations and cost savings formula
# - Added comprehensive variance reporting
#
# METRICS GLOSSARY:
# AUC: Area Under ROC Curve (0.5 = random, 1.0 = perfect)
# PR-AUC: Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (better for imbalanced data)
# Brier_Score: Mean squared error of probability predictions (0 = perfect, 1 = worst)
# ECE: Expected Calibration Error - measures probability calibration quality
# Calibration_Slope: Slope of calibration curve (1.0 = perfectly calibrated)
# Lift: Ratio of default rate in top k% vs overall default rate
# DeLong_Test: Statistical test comparing two AUCs (approximation using bootstrap)
# Bootstrap_CI: 95% confidence interval from 1000 bootstrap resamples
# CV_Folds: 5-fold stratified cross-validation
# AUC_Improvement: AUC_variant - AUC_traditional (positive = improvement)
# Brier_Improvement: Brier_original - Brier_calibrated (positive = improvement)
# Cost_Savings: Expected cost savings from model deployment
