# INTEGRATED COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS RESULTS
# AUC: Area Under ROC Curve (0.5 = random, 1.0 = perfect)
# PR_AUC: Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (better for imbalanced data)
# Brier_Score: Mean squared error of probability predictions (0 = perfect, 1 = worst)
# ECE: Expected Calibration Error - measures probability calibration quality
# Calibration_Slope: Slope of calibration curve (1.0 = perfectly calibrated)
# Lift: Ratio of default rate in top k% vs overall default rate
# DeLong_Test: Statistical test comparing two AUCs using t-test on CV differences
# Permutation_Test: Shuffles sentiment features to test null hypothesis
# Bootstrap_CI: 95% confidence interval from 1000 bootstrap resamples
# CV_Folds: 5-fold stratified cross-validation
# TTR: Type-Token Ratio - lexical diversity measure
# AUC_Improvement: AUC_variant - AUC_traditional (positive = improvement)
# Brier_Improvement: Brier_traditional - Brier_variant (positive = improvement)
# Generated: 2025-08-14T22:21:58.465899
# Realistic targets with meaningful feature relationships
# Comprehensive statistical validation with bootstrap CIs
# DeLong tests, calibration metrics, permutation tests
# Academic rigor with transparent methodology
