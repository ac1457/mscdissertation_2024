# LEGEND
# AUC: Area Under ROC Curve (0.5 = random, 1.0 = perfect)
# PR_AUC: Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (better for imbalanced data)
# Brier_Score: Mean squared error of probability predictions (0 = perfect, 1 = worst)
# Brier_Improvement: Brier_traditional - Brier_variant (positive = improvement)
# AUC_Improvement: AUC_variant - AUC_traditional (positive = improvement)
# Statistical_Testing: Statistical testing pending - DeLong test and bootstrap CIs needed
# Precision: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
# Recall: True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
# F1_Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
# Lift: Ratio of default rate in top k% vs overall default rate
# Capture_Rate: Percentage of all defaults captured in top k%
