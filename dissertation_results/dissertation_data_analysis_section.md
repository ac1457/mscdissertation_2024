# 3. Data Analysis

## 3.1 Data Collection

### 3.1.1 Source and Description

The primary dataset for this research is the Lending Club loan data, obtained from Kaggle (wordsforthewise/lending-club). Lending Club is one of the largest peer-to-peer lending platforms in the United States, providing comprehensive loan application and outcome data from 2007 to 2018.

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- **Source**: Lending Club platform (2007-2018)
- **Original Size**: 2,260,701 loan records
- **Processed Sample**: 97,020 records (for computational efficiency)
- **Time Period**: 11 years of lending data
- **Geographic Coverage**: United States

The data collection process involved downloading the complete Lending Club dataset from Kaggle using the `kagglehub` library, followed by systematic sampling to create a computationally manageable dataset while maintaining representativeness across loan grades, purposes, and temporal periods.

### 3.1.2 Data Attributes

**Structured Data:**
The dataset contains comprehensive traditional credit risk indicators across multiple categories, as implemented in the `real_data_loader.py` module:

- **Demographic Features (16 features)**: Age, annual income, employment length, home ownership status, geographic location (state, zip code)
- **Financial Features (10 features)**: Loan amount, funded amount, interest rate, installment amount, debt-to-income ratio (DTI)
- **Credit History Features (21 features)**: FICO score ranges, number of open accounts, public records, bankruptcies, credit inquiries, delinquency history
- **Loan Characteristics (9 features)**: Loan purpose, term, credit grade, sub-grade, verification status

**Unstructured Data:**
- **Loan Descriptions**: Borrower-provided text explaining loan purpose and circumstances
- **Coverage**: 93,476 records (96.3%) had missing descriptions
- **Solution**: Purpose-based synthetic text generation with natural language variation
- **Quality**: Comprehensive sentiment and complexity features extracted

The synthetic text generation was implemented in the `generate_synthetic_text_for_missing()` method, which created realistic loan descriptions based on loan purpose templates while introducing natural variation to avoid artificial patterns.

## 3.2 Data Pre-processing and Feature Engineering

### 3.2.1 Missing Values

**Missing Data Analysis:**
Based on the comprehensive missing data analysis conducted in `generate_dissertation_data_analysis_fixed.py`, the dataset demonstrates excellent data quality:

- **Overall Missing Rate**: 0.60% of all values
- **Text Descriptions**: 96.3% missing - addressed through synthetic generation
- **Employment Information**: 7.4% missing - filled with mode values
- **Financial Ratios**: 0.1% missing - filled with median values
- **Credit History**: Variable missing rates (0.1% - 15.2%) - handled through appropriate imputation

**Synthetic Text Generation Methodology:**
The synthetic text generation approach was implemented in the `real_data_loader.py` module with the following methodology:

1. **Template Creation**: Developed realistic loan description templates for each loan purpose (debt consolidation, credit card, home improvement, etc.)
2. **Variation Introduction**: Added natural language variation using synonym replacement and sentence restructuring
3. **Contextual Alignment**: Ensured generated text aligns with loan characteristics (amount, purpose, income level)
4. **Quality Validation**: Implemented distribution similarity tests using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to validate synthetic text quality

**Imputation Strategies for Structured Data:**
As implemented in the data preprocessing pipeline:
- **Categorical Variables**: Mode imputation for employment information, verification status
- **Numerical Variables**: Median imputation for financial ratios, credit scores
- **Threshold**: Removed records with >50% missing values to maintain data quality

### 3.2.2 Encoding Categorical Variables

**Label Encoding Implementation:**
The categorical variable encoding was implemented in the feature engineering pipeline:

- **Loan Purpose**: Encoded 14 distinct purposes (debt_consolidation, credit_card, home_improvement, major_purchase, medical, etc.)
- **Credit Grade**: A through G grades encoded numerically (A=1, B=2, etc.)
- **Home Ownership**: MORTGAGE, RENT, OWN, OTHER encoded as categorical variables
- **Verification Status**: Verified, Not Verified, Source Verified encoded
- **Employment Length**: <1 year, 1 year, 2 years, ..., 10+ years encoded numerically

The encoding process used scikit-learn's `LabelEncoder` and pandas' categorical encoding methods to ensure consistent representation across the dataset.

### 3.2.3 Removing Outliers

**Outlier Detection and Removal:**
Based on the data quality analysis conducted in the preprocessing pipeline:

- **Loan Amounts**: Removed extreme outliers (>$100,000) to focus on typical consumer loans
- **Income Values**: Capped at $1,000,000 for realistic analysis and to prevent skewing
- **DTI Ratios**: Limited to 0-100% range for valid debt-to-income ratios
- **Interest Rates**: Validated against market ranges (5% - 35%) to ensure realistic values

The outlier removal process was implemented using percentile-based methods and domain knowledge to maintain data quality while preserving the natural distribution of lending data.

### 3.2.4 Normalization

**Scaling Approach:**
The normalization process was implemented using scikit-learn's preprocessing modules:

- **Standard Scaling**: Applied to numerical features (loan amount, income, DTI, etc.) for model training
- **Min-Max Scaling**: Used for features requiring bounded ranges (0-1 normalization)
- **Robust Scaling**: Applied to features with outliers for stability during model training

The scaling was implemented in the `enhanced_comprehensive_analysis.py` module to ensure consistent feature scaling across all model training and evaluation phases.

### 3.2.5 Class Imbalance

**Default Rate Analysis:**
Based on the target variable analysis conducted in the data processing pipeline:

- **Overall Default Rate**: 13.1% (12,710 defaults out of 97,020 loans)
- **Class Imbalance**: Significant imbalance requiring careful handling in model development

**Multiple Risk Regimes Design:**
To test model robustness across different risk environments, three default rate regimes were constructed as implemented in the analysis modules:

1. **Conservative Regime (5% default rate)**: Higher credit quality, lower risk loans
2. **Moderate Regime (10% default rate)**: Balanced risk profile
3. **Aggressive Regime (15% default rate)**: Higher risk, lower credit quality

**Stratification and Balancing Applied:**
As implemented in the cross-validation and sampling strategies:
- **Stratified Sampling**: Maintained proportional representation across loan grades
- **Balanced Training**: Used stratified cross-validation to ensure balanced representation
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Employed metrics robust to class imbalance (PR-AUC, F1-score, lift metrics)
