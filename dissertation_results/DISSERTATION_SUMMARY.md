# Dissertation Summary - Lending Club Sentiment Analysis

## Research Question
Does adding sentiment features enhance traditional credit models in credit risk assessment?

## Key Findings

### 1. Modest but Consistent Improvements
- **Absolute AUC improvements**: 0.001-0.039 (modest absolute gains)
- **Best performance**: 0.6327 AUC (5% default rate, LogisticRegression Hybrid)
- **Improvements shrink** as default rate increases (5% > 10% > 15%)
- **Industry gap**: 2.7-19.7% depending on benchmark and default rate

### 2. Statistical Significance
- **5 out of 6 comparisons** show statistically significant improvements
- **DeLong tests** confirm significance (p < 1e-15 to 2.13e-10)
- **Multiple comparison correction** applied (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR)
- **Confidence intervals** provided for all metrics

### 3. Methodological Contributions
- **Synthetic text generation** addresses data scarcity in credit modeling research
- **Data leakage prevention** with proper feature exclusion
- **Realistic prevalence testing** with 5%, 10%, 15% default rates
- **Comprehensive validation** with statistical rigor

### 4. Practical Implications
- **Modest improvements** may not justify implementation costs without cost-benefit analysis
- **Focus on lower default rates** (5-10%) for maximum benefit
- **Hybrid features** most effective approach
- **Further validation** required on representative datasets

## Academic Value

### Research Contributions
1. **Empirical Investigation**: Honest assessment of sentiment's role in credit modeling
2. **Methodological Innovation**: Synthetic text generation for data scarcity
3. **Industry Context**: Realistic comparison to production standards
4. **Transparency**: Complete documentation and honest reporting

### Methodological Rigor
- **Proper statistical testing** with DeLong tests and confidence intervals
- **Data leakage prevention** with systematic feature exclusion
- **Realistic prevalence scenarios** testing multiple default rates
- **Complete transparency** in methodology and limitations

## Conclusion

Sentiment analysis integration shows **modest but consistent improvements** to traditional credit models, with realistic prevalence scenarios confirming incremental rather than transformative gains. While the improvements are modest (ΔAUC 0.001-0.039), they approach industry standards in lower default rate scenarios and demonstrate the potential value of text-based features in credit risk assessment.

The methodological approach provides a foundation for future research in this area, with synthetic text generation addressing critical data scarcity challenges. Implementation should be approached cautiously, with careful consideration of costs, benefits, and validation requirements.
