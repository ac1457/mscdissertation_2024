# 3. Data Analysis

## 3.1 Data Collection

### 3.1.1 Source and Description
The primary dataset for this research is the Lending Club loan data, obtained from Kaggle (wordsforthewise/lending-club). Lending Club is one of the largest peer-to-peer lending platforms in the United States, providing comprehensive loan application and outcome data from 2007 to 2018.

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- **Source**: Lending Club platform (2007-2018)
- **Original Size**: 2,260,701 loan records
- **Processed Sample**: 97,020 records (for computational efficiency)
- **Time Period**: 11 years of lending data
- **Geographic Coverage**: United States

### 3.1.2 Data Attributes

**Structured Data:**
The dataset contains comprehensive traditional credit risk indicators across multiple categories:

- **Demographic Features (16 features)**: Age, annual income, employment length, home ownership status, geographic location (state, zip code)
- **Financial Features (10 features)**: Loan amount, funded amount, interest rate, installment amount, debt-to-income ratio (DTI)
- **Credit History Features (21 features)**: FICO score ranges, number of open accounts, public records, bankruptcies, credit inquiries, delinquency history
- **Loan Characteristics (9 features)**: Loan purpose, term, credit grade, sub-grade, verification status

**Unstructured Data:**
- **Loan Descriptions**: Borrower-provided text explaining loan purpose and circumstances
- **Coverage**: 93,476 records (96.3%) had missing descriptions
- **Solution**: Purpose-based synthetic text generation with natural language variation
- **Quality**: Comprehensive sentiment and complexity features extracted

## 3.2 Data Pre-processing and Feature Engineering

### 3.2.1 Missing Values

**Missing Data Analysis:**
- **Overall Missing Rate**: 0.60% of all values
- **Text Descriptions**: 96.3% missing - addressed through synthetic generation
- **Employment Information**: 7.4% missing - filled with mode values
- **Financial Ratios**: 0.1% missing - filled with median values
- **Credit History**: Variable missing rates (0.1% - 15.2%) - handled through appropriate imputation

**Synthetic Text Generation Methodology:**
To address the significant missing text data, a purpose-based synthetic text generation approach was implemented:

1. **Template Creation**: Developed realistic loan description templates for each loan purpose
2. **Variation Introduction**: Added natural language variation to avoid artificial patterns
3. **Contextual Alignment**: Ensured generated text aligns with loan characteristics (amount, purpose, income)
4. **Quality Validation**: Implemented distribution similarity tests using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests

**Imputation Strategies for Structured Data:**
- **Categorical Variables**: Mode imputation for employment information, verification status
- **Numerical Variables**: Median imputation for financial ratios, credit scores
- **Threshold**: Removed records with >50% missing values

### 3.2.2 Encoding Categorical Variables

**Label Encoding Implementation:**
- **Loan Purpose**: Encoded 14 distinct purposes (debt_consolidation, credit_card, home_improvement, etc.)
- **Credit Grade**: A through G grades encoded numerically
- **Home Ownership**: MORTGAGE, RENT, OWN, OTHER encoded as categorical
- **Verification Status**: Verified, Not Verified, Source Verified encoded
- **Employment Length**: <1 year, 1 year, 2 years, ..., 10+ years encoded

### 3.2.3 Removing Outliers

**Outlier Detection and Removal:**
- **Loan Amounts**: Removed extreme outliers (>$100,000) to focus on typical consumer loans
- **Income Values**: Capped at $1,000,000 for realistic analysis
- **DTI Ratios**: Limited to 0-100% range for valid debt-to-income ratios
- **Interest Rates**: Validated against market ranges (5% - 35%)

### 3.2.4 Normalization

**Scaling Approach:**
- **Standard Scaling**: Applied to numerical features for model training
- **Min-Max Scaling**: Used for features requiring bounded ranges
- **Robust Scaling**: Applied to features with outliers for stability

### 3.2.5 Class Imbalance

**Default Rate Analysis:**
- **Overall Default Rate**: 13.1% (12,710 defaults out of 97,020 loans)
- **Class Imbalance**: Significant imbalance requiring careful handling

**Multiple Risk Regimes Design:**
To test model robustness across different risk environments, three default rate regimes were constructed:

1. **Conservative Regime (5% default rate)**: Higher credit quality, lower risk loans
2. **Moderate Regime (10% default rate)**: Balanced risk profile
3. **Aggressive Regime (15% default rate)**: Higher risk, lower credit quality

**Stratification and Balancing Applied:**
- **Stratified Sampling**: Maintained proportional representation across loan grades
- **Balanced Training**: Used stratified cross-validation to ensure balanced representation
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Employed metrics robust to class imbalance (PR-AUC, F1-score)
