COMPREHENSIVE FIX SUMMARY
=========================

INTEGRITY STATUS:
-----------------
Row alignment: ✅ PASS
ID persistence: ✅ PASS
Split consistency: ✅ PASS

RESULTS SUMMARY:
----------------
Total models evaluated: 9
Anomalies detected: 9

AUC Performance:
- Range: 0.5004 - 0.5117
- Mean: 0.5058
- Anomalies: 9

KS Performance:
- Range: 0.0103 - 0.0287
- Mean: 0.0189
- Anomalies: 9

Lift Performance:
- Range: 1.00 - 1.08
- Mean: 1.04
- Anomalies: 9

Permutation Tests:
- Completed: 6
- Significant (p < 0.05): 2

FILES GENERATED:
----------------
- final_corrected_results.csv: Unified results with integrity checks
- train_ids.txt: Train set sample IDs
- test_ids.txt: Test set sample IDs
- predictions_*.csv: Individual model predictions with IDs

RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------
1. Use final_corrected_results.csv for final analysis
2. Exclude rows with Anomaly_Note from substantive claims
3. Document integrity checks in methodology
4. Implement ID-based joins in future analyses
