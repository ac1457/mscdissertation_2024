## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Research Design

This study employs a quantitative research design to investigate the effectiveness of sentiment analysis in enhancing credit risk prediction models. The research follows a comparative experimental approach, evaluating traditional credit risk models against sentiment-enhanced alternatives using the Lending Club dataset.

- Employment: employment length, home ownership

**Sentiment Features (5 features):**
- Sentiment score: normalized sentiment polarity (0-1)
- Sentiment confidence: reliability of sentiment classification
- Sentiment strength: absolute magnitude of sentiment
- Confident positive/negative indicators: high-confidence sentiment classifications

**Advanced Engineered Features (106 features):**
- Text analysis: TF-IDF features, readability metrics, financial language detection
- Temporal features: seasonal indicators, economic period markers
- Interaction features: loan-to-income ratios, interest rate transformations
- Risk scores: composite risk measures, financial ratios
- Quality indicators: text complexity, data completeness measures

Sophisticated interaction features capture non-linear relationships:

**Financial Interactions:**

- Composite risk scores combining multiple risk factors
- Weighted risk measures (40% credit risk + 30% income stability + 30% loan risk)
