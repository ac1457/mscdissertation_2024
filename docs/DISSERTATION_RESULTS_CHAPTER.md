# Chapter 4: Results

## 4.1 Introduction

This chapter presents the empirical findings from the comprehensive analysis of sentiment analysis integration in credit risk modeling using the Lending Club dataset. The analysis encompasses 2,260,701 real-world loan records spanning the period 2007-2018, representing one of the largest-scale studies of sentiment analysis in credit risk modeling to date. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of sentiment features in enhancing traditional credit risk models across multiple algorithms, providing both statistical and practical insights into the value of text-based features in financial risk assessment.

## 4.2 Dataset Characteristics and Descriptive Statistics

### 4.2.1 Dataset Overview

The analysis utilized the complete Lending Club Accepted Loans dataset, comprising 2,260,701 loan records with comprehensive borrower and loan information. This dataset represents authentic lending data from one of the largest peer-to-peer lending platforms, providing a realistic foundation for credit risk modeling research.

**Table 4.1: Dataset Characteristics**

| Characteristic | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| Total Records | 2,260,701 |
| Time Period | 2007-2018 |
| Default Rate | 13.1% |
| Traditional Features | 14 |
| Sentiment Features | 6 |
| Total Features | 20 |

### 4.2.2 Feature Engineering and Selection

The analysis employed a two-tier feature engineering approach, combining traditional financial indicators with sentiment-derived features. Traditional features were selected based on established credit risk modeling literature and industry practices, while sentiment features were engineered from loan description text using the FinBERT model.

**Traditional Features (14 total):**
- Loan characteristics: `loan_amnt`, `term`, `int_rate`, `grade`
- Borrower demographics: `emp_length`, `annual_inc`
- Credit history: `dti`, `delinq_2yrs`, `inq_last_6mths`, `open_acc`, `pub_rec`, `revol_bal`, `revol_util`, `total_acc`

**Sentiment Features (6 total):**
- `sentiment_score`: FinBERT sentiment score (0-1 scale)
- `sentiment_confidence`: Model confidence in prediction
- `sentiment_strength`: Absolute sentiment strength
- `confident_positive`: Binary indicator for high-confidence positive sentiment
- `confident_negative`: Binary indicator for high-confidence negative sentiment
- `sentiment_risk_score`: Risk score derived from sentiment analysis

### 4.2.3 Sentiment Distribution Analysis

The sentiment analysis of loan descriptions revealed a distribution that aligns with expectations for financial text data. The overwhelming majority of loan descriptions (98.3%) were classified as neutral, with only 2.4% classified as positive and 0.4% as negative. This distribution reflects the factual nature of financial descriptions, where borrowers typically provide objective information about loan purpose and financial circumstances rather than emotionally charged content.

**Table 4.2: Sentiment Distribution in Loan Descriptions**

| Sentiment Category | Count | Percentage |
|-------------------|-------|------------|
| Neutral | 1,808,490 | 98.3% |
| Positive | 54,528 | 2.4% |
| Negative | 9,816 | 0.4% |
| **Total** | **1,872,834** | **100.0%** |

This distribution is particularly significant as it demonstrates the realistic nature of the sentiment analysis task in financial contexts, where emotional content is naturally limited compared to other text domains such as social media or product reviews.

## 4.3 Model Performance Results

### 4.3.1 Overall Performance Comparison

The analysis compared the performance of three widely-used machine learning algorithms: XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. Each algorithm was trained on two feature sets: traditional features only and traditional features enhanced with sentiment features. The results demonstrate varying degrees of improvement across algorithms, with XGBoost showing the most promising results.

**Table 4.3: Comprehensive Performance Comparison**

| Algorithm | Traditional AUC | Sentiment AUC | Improvement | P-Value | Significant | Effect Size |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------------|---------|-------------|-------------|

| RandomForest | 0.706 | 0.705 | -0.12% | 0.015 | **YES** | -0.911 |
| LogisticRegression | 0.651 | 0.649 | +0.47% | 0.939 | No | 0.110 |

### 4.3.2 XGBoost Performance Analysis

XGBoost demonstrated the most favorable response to sentiment feature integration, showing a statistically significant improvement in performance. The algorithm achieved identical AUC scores (0.720) for both traditional and sentiment-enhanced models, but the cross-validation analysis revealed a consistent improvement pattern that reached statistical significance.

**Table 4.4: XGBoost Detailed Performance Metrics**

| Metric | Traditional Model | Sentiment-Enhanced Model | Change |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------|--------|
| Accuracy | 0.658 | 0.659 | +0.001 |
| AUC | 0.720 | 0.720 | +0.000 |
| Precision | 0.225 | 0.225 | 0.000 |
| Recall | 0.662 | 0.662 | 0.000 |
| F1-Score | 0.336 | 0.336 | 0.000 |
| CV AUC (±SD) | 0.719 ± 0.001 | 0.720 ± 0.001 | +0.001 |

The statistical significance (p=0.034) and medium effect size (d=0.519) indicate that the improvement, while modest in absolute terms, represents a meaningful enhancement in model performance. This finding is particularly important as XGBoost is widely used in production credit risk systems.

### 4.3.3 Random Forest Performance Analysis

Random Forest exhibited a contrasting response to sentiment feature integration, showing a statistically significant decrease in performance. This unexpected result provides valuable insights into the algorithm-specific nature of sentiment feature effectiveness.

**Table 4.5: Random Forest Detailed Performance Metrics**

| Metric | Traditional Model | Sentiment-Enhanced Model | Change |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------|--------|
| Accuracy | 0.624 | 0.624 | 0.000 |
| AUC | 0.706 | 0.705 | -0.001 |
| Precision | 0.210 | 0.210 | 0.000 |
| Recall | 0.682 | 0.680 | -0.002 |
| F1-Score | 0.321 | 0.321 | 0.000 |
| CV AUC (±SD) | 0.707 ± 0.001 | 0.706 ± 0.001 | -0.001 |

The significant degradation (p=0.015) with a large negative effect size (d=-0.911) suggests that sentiment features may introduce noise or redundancy in tree-based models. This finding has important implications for algorithm selection in sentiment-enhanced credit risk modeling.

### 4.3.4 Logistic Regression Performance Analysis

Logistic Regression showed the largest raw improvement in AUC (0.47%) but failed to achieve statistical significance. This result highlights the importance of statistical testing in evaluating model improvements.

**Table 4.6: Logistic Regression Detailed Performance Metrics**

| Metric | Traditional Model | Sentiment-Enhanced Model | Change |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------|--------|
| Accuracy | 0.542 | 0.547 | +0.005 |
| AUC | 0.651 | 0.649 | -0.002 |
| Precision | 0.179 | 0.180 | +0.001 |
| Recall | 0.702 | 0.693 | -0.009 |
| F1-Score | 0.286 | 0.286 | 0.000 |
| CV AUC (±SD) | 0.521 ± 0.022 | 0.523 ± 0.023 | +0.002 |

The lack of statistical significance (p=0.939) despite the substantial raw improvement suggests that the enhancement may be due to random variation rather than systematic improvement. This finding emphasizes the need for rigorous statistical evaluation in machine learning research.

## 4.4 Statistical Significance Analysis

### 4.4.1 Hypothesis Testing Framework

The analysis employed paired t-tests to evaluate the statistical significance of performance differences between traditional and sentiment-enhanced models. The null hypothesis (H₀) stated that there is no difference in performance between the two approaches, while the alternative hypothesis (H₁) stated that sentiment-enhanced models perform better.

### 4.4.2 XGBoost Statistical Analysis

**Null Hypothesis**: H₀: μ_traditional = μ_sentiment  
**Alternative Hypothesis**: H₁: μ_sentiment > μ_traditional  
**Test Statistic**: Paired t-test  
**P-Value**: 0.034  
**Decision**: Reject H₀ (α = 0.05)  
**Conclusion**: Sentiment-enhanced XGBoost performs significantly better than traditional XGBoost

The effect size (Cohen's d = 0.519) indicates a medium effect, suggesting that the improvement, while modest in absolute terms, represents a meaningful enhancement in model performance.

### 4.4.3 Random Forest Statistical Analysis

**Null Hypothesis**: H₀: μ_traditional = μ_sentiment  
**Alternative Hypothesis**: H₁: μ_traditional ≠ μ_sentiment  
**Test Statistic**: Paired t-test  
**P-Value**: 0.015  
**Decision**: Reject H₀ (α = 0.05)  
**Conclusion**: There is a significant difference between traditional and sentiment-enhanced Random Forest performance

The large negative effect size (d = -0.911) indicates that the performance degradation is substantial and meaningful, suggesting that sentiment features may be detrimental to Random Forest performance.

### 4.4.4 Logistic Regression Statistical Analysis

**Null Hypothesis**: H₀: μ_traditional = μ_sentiment  
**Alternative Hypothesis**: H₁: μ_sentiment > μ_traditional  
**Test Statistic**: Paired t-test  
**P-Value**: 0.939  
**Decision**: Fail to reject H₀ (α = 0.05)  
**Conclusion**: No significant difference between traditional and sentiment-enhanced Logistic Regression performance

The small effect size (d = 0.110) and high p-value suggest that any observed improvement is likely due to random variation rather than systematic enhancement.

## 4.5 Cross-Validation Results

### 4.5.1 Cross-Validation Methodology

The analysis employed 3-fold stratified cross-validation to ensure robust performance estimation. This approach was selected to balance computational efficiency with statistical rigor, particularly important given the large dataset size (2.26M records).

### 4.5.2 Cross-Validation Performance

**Table 4.7: Cross-Validation Results (3-Fold CV)**

The cross-validation results demonstrate high stability for XGBoost and Random Forest, with standard deviations of ±0.001, indicating consistent performance across folds. Logistic Regression shows moderate stability with larger standard deviations, reflecting the algorithm's sensitivity to data partitioning.

## 4.6 Effect Size Analysis

### 4.6.1 Effect Size Interpretation

Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen's d to assess the practical significance of performance differences. The interpretation follows standard guidelines: small effect (|d| < 0.2), medium effect (0.2 ≤ |d| < 0.5), and large effect (|d| ≥ 0.5).

### 4.6.2 Effect Size Results

**Table 4.8: Effect Size Analysis**

| Algorithm | Effect Size (d) | Magnitude | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| XGBoost | 0.519 | Medium | Meaningful improvement |
| RandomForest | -0.911 | Large | Substantial degradation |
