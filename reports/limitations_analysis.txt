LIMITATIONS ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES
============================================================

POTENTIAL LIMITATIONS:
------------------------------
DATA_QUALITY:
  Limitation: Synthetic data may not fully capture real-world complexity
  Impact: Medium
  Solution: Use multiple data sources and validate against real-world benchmarks
  Mitigation: Conduct sensitivity analysis and robustness testing

SENTIMENT_ACCURACY:
  Limitation: Sentiment analysis may not capture nuanced financial contexts
  Impact: High
  Solution: Use domain-specific sentiment models (FinBERT)
  Mitigation: Validate sentiment scores against expert assessments

FAIRNESS_CONCERNS:
  Limitation: Model may introduce bias against certain demographic groups
  Impact: High
  Solution: Implement fairness-aware algorithms and regular audits
  Mitigation: Use multiple fairness metrics and demographic parity testing

REGULATORY_COMPLIANCE:
  Limitation: Model must comply with financial regulations and explainability requirements
  Impact: High
  Solution: Use interpretable models and maintain audit trails
  Mitigation: Regular compliance reviews and documentation

SCALABILITY:
  Limitation: Hybrid model may be computationally expensive for large datasets
  Impact: Medium
  Solution: Optimize algorithms and use efficient data structures
  Mitigation: Conduct performance testing and optimization

TEMPORAL_STABILITY:
  Limitation: Model performance may degrade over time due to changing patterns
  Impact: Medium
  Solution: Implement model retraining and drift detection
  Mitigation: Regular model validation and performance monitoring

OVERALL MITIGATION STRATEGY:
------------------------------
1. Comprehensive testing and validation
2. Regular model monitoring and updates
3. Stakeholder engagement and feedback
4. Continuous improvement and adaptation
5. Robust documentation and audit trails
