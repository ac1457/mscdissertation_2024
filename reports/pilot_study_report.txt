PILOT STUDY REPORT - HYBRID MODEL VALIDATION
============================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
------------------------------
This pilot study validates the feasibility of the hybrid model combining
traditional financial features with sentiment analysis for credit risk modeling.

KEY FINDINGS:
- Hybrid model shows improved performance over traditional models
- Fairness metrics demonstrate equitable treatment across demographic groups
- Model is computationally feasible and scalable
- Sentiment features provide valuable predictive information
